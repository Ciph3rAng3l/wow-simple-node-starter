@WalmartLabs & MindTouch Hackathon Starter App & Info
===

This document should contain all the information you need to get started. Feel free to use any programming language you feel most comfortable with, but this repository has an optional simple Node.js + Materialize + Jade template project that is ready to deploy to Heroku. If you or one of your team members is familiar with Node, AJAX, or HTML + CSS3, especially within in the context of creating a full stack application, try out our starter app. Please follow the final submission instructions for **all** applications.

# Set-Up
- [ ] Create a GitHub Account: https://github.com/
- [ ] Git Set-Up: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/
- [ ] Node and npm Installation: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
- [ ] Create Heroku Account: https://signup.heroku.com/dc
- [ ] Download Heroku CLI: https://cli.heroku.com/
- [ ] Download an IDE. Check out the recommended ones:
    - Sublime Text 3: https://www.sublimetext.com/3
    - Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
    - Atom: https://atom.io/

# Usage
1. **Fork your repository** - Have 1 person from your team fork the repository so that you have a copy of the codebase you can freely modify without affecting the original: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/.

2. **Clone your repository** - Each team member will clone a copy of this forked repository onto their desktop to work on individually. That way, everyone can work on their project individually and eventually merge: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/

2. **Install** - Verify that you have the correct node version and then install the application. Verify your node version by entering `node -v`. Your node version should be *4.26* or above. Then do a `npm install` to install the app.

3. **Start the app** - Once it has finished installing, run the application by entering `node app`. Do a Ctrl+C if you ever want to stop the application.

4. **View the app** - Open up your browser and go to http://localhost:3000. If you can view the app successfully, you're ready to make your own changes and go! Open up your text editor, open up the directory your repository is located, and start coding!     - Try experimenting with the values in the `views`, such as changing the text in `views/index.jade`
    - Don't worry too much about the other folders (`node_modules`, `bin`, `routes`) but don't delete them because they are necessary to deploy to Heroku.
    - Once you've made a change, simply hit save in your text editor. Go back to http://localhost:3000 and your change should be there. Happy coding!

5. **Build Something Awesome!** - Wow us with a full stack application that will engage users with incredible UX and Walmart's Open API. Here are a few helpful links that will familiarize you with the technologies in this starter:
[Jade](http://learnjade.com/) + a helpful Jade to HTML [converter](http://html2jade.org/), [Node](https://www.nodebeginner.org/) + [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) + [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/).

# Coding
- Use [GitHub](https://github.com/) for adding, committing, branching, and creating PRs. Here is a [quick guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and [useful tips](https://github.com/vasanthk/git-tips-and-tricks#squash-pr-commits-into-one) for development.
- Get data, the [Walmart way](https://developer.walmartlabs.com/).
- Don't get too deep into the coding and forget one of the biggest parts - presentation. If you are submitting a presentation powerpoint, please use [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/) rather than a desktop powerpoint application. See below for [Final Submission](#final-submission) and [Judging Criteria](#judging-criteria).
- Have fun!

# Final Submission
You will be deploying your final base application to Heroku, a platform to host your application. You will be submiting the Heroku application for the final submission. *Please only make 1 submission per team.*
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs#deploy-your-application-to-heroku

1. Once you're ready to go, do `heroku login` and enter in your credentials.
2. Do a `heroku create` and then a `git push heroku master`
3. Do `heroku open` to open up your application. A browser should open up with your app.
4. Grab the link of your app and submit your app here: https://goo.gl/forms/APIvHIbkVN5ehcOi1
5. Congratulations! You're done!

# Themes
- *Every Day Low Prices:* Walmart's motto for the longest time - from the days of Sam Walton to today's world of eCommerce - is "Every Day Low Prices." Walmart aims to feature a great selection of high quality merchandise for affordable prices. Build an application that aims to help users save money in their day to day lives to improve their overall quality of life. This could be anything from helping people budget or presenting data to help users make more informed choices.
- *Walmart in eCommerce:* Walmart.com was founded in January 2000 as a subsidary of Wal-mart Stores Inc. One of the driving forces behind Walmart.com is us - @WalmartLabs. At the end of the day, Walmart serves as a retailer to the customers whether through stores, online, or mobile devices. In order to serve the millions of customers with our 1,000,000 products available online, we need the technology to support it. Today, you have the opportunity to take a look behind the scenes and experiment with our technology, the Walmart API. Build something - anything at all with our Walmart API. Be creative!
- *Power of Technology:* From modest beginnings in northwestern Arkansas in 1962, Walmart has grown to become a worldwide household name thanks to Sam Walton. Only in 2000 did Walmart move into the eCommerce world and continue growing as one of the largest retailers, in both the physical and digital world. Today, Walmart.com has 1,000,000 products available for their customers to show at their convenience whether it be online, in person, or even ordering online and picking up in stores! Build an application that renovates something old and brings a new modern spin to it to better assist people today.

# About
This starter was inspired by the [Node.js Material Starter Template](https://github.com/primaryobjects/Node.js-Material-Starter-Template), but updated for Heroku deployment, Materialize + Express routes.
Here is an [example app](https://wow-hackathon-example-app.herokuapp.com/) using this starter + the Walmart Open API. You `may need` this help chrome tool to view the data in this example app - [Allow-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en-US).
